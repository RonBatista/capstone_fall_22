To use the tool, the user first needs to specify the project's name, an Orthomosaic file, a Boundary file,
the sensor and platform that were used to take the Orthomosaic image and optionally a Canopy Height
Model file. After choosing an Orthomosaic/Canopy Height Model file, the user can specify
what canopy attributes to generate including the Canopy Cover, Canopy Height, Canopy Volume
and Excess Greeness. It's important to note, the Canopy Height and Volume can not be generated unless a
Canopy height Model file is specified. After clicking the "Generate Results" button, the user can
then select the canopy attributes and file formats (Shape, GeoJSON, CSV and XLSX) they would like
to download. The generated files are available to download through the "Download Generated Files"
button, which will then download a Zip file of the specified attributes and file formats.
